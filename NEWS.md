# equatags 0.2.1

- add a `display` argument to transform_mathjax() to allow generating display or inline equations. It is set to FALSE by default (inline equation). This changes the behaviour that was previously to generate display equations only.
- delete unused mathjax-npm related tools.

# equatags 0.2.0

-   drop the node.js dependency in favor of package katex.

# equatags 0.1.1

-   use tools::R_user_dir instead of rappdirs::user_data_dir as it's a condition to keep the package on CRAN ("This is using \^\~/.local/share/equatags , prohibited by the CRAN policy. Please replace the use of rappdirs by the allowed procedure documented there.")
